* Learn HtmlCssJavascript(HCJ) by doing


** introduction

In this notes, we proposed a learning path for HCJ. The idea is to repeat the loop of "creating page-deploy/test-learn new featuresa and improve page-deploy/test again-...". In each step, some new features learned will added to the page, then the page will be deployed and tested. By this way, features of HCJ are learned by practicing gradually.  

** minmial page
The pagesindex.html is located in the directory:
/home/zyd/projects/hcj/c1/hcj_test/site

Also, it can be syncnized with the github page by using below command:
git add .
git commit

1. goto repository and click the settings button
2. Or use
https://github.com/TT1232/hcj_test/settings/pages
3. Then we can find page test link is:
